The initial goal is to build an Openstreetmap tile loading mesh floor,
and a camera that can be positioned at a world position. The system must have:
* Tile image are loaded from Openstreetmap on tile meshes
* A collection of tile meshes are positioned in such a way that a coherent map is visible on the floor
* Slippy map coordinates must be translated to Bevy world coordinates
